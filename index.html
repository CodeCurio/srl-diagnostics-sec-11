              <h2>TMT Examination (Treadmill Test)</h2>
              <p>A treadmill (TMT) test, also known as a cardiac stress test, determines how far your heart can go before developing an irregular heartbeat or a lack of blood supply to the heart muscle. It enables your doctor to examine how your heart responds when pressed. You'll have to walk or run, with the difficulty gradually increasing.</p>

              <h2>EEG (Electroencephalogram)</h2>
              <p>An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that measures electrical activity in the brain using small metal discs (electrodes) attached to the scalp. Brain cells communicate via electrical impulses and are constantly active, even when sleeping. This activity appears as wavy lines on an EEG recording.

                One of the most important diagnostic tests for epilepsy is an EEG. An EEG can also be used to diagnose other brain disorders. </p>

              <h2>Mammography</h2>
              <p>Mammography, also known as mammogram or mastography, examines the human breast with low-energy X-rays for early detection and screening. The primary goal of mammography, in addition to regular clinical exams and monthly breast self-examinations, is to detect breast cancer early, typically through the detection of characteristic masses or microcalcifications.</p>

              <h2>Echocardiogram</h2>

          <div class="service-card right">
              <h2>CT Scan</h2>
              <p>Doctors can see inside your body with a computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan. It creates images of your organs, bones, and other tissues using X-rays and a computer. It provides more information than a standard X-ray.
                A CT scan can be performed on any part of your body. The procedure takes only a few minutes and is completely painless..</p>

              <h2>OPG</h2>
              <p>Radiation is used in X-rays to create images of bones and other internal organs.
                A X-ray of the upper and lower jaws, including the teeth, is called an OPG.
                During the scan, the OPG unit is designed to rotate around the patient's head. An OPG will take about 20 seconds.</p>

          <div class="service-card right">
              <h2>MRI</h2>
              <p>MRI scanners are particularly well suited to imaging non-bony body parts or soft tissuesThey differ from computed tomography (CT) in that they do not use the potentially harmful ionising radiation of x-rays. The brain, spinal cord, and nerves, as well as muscles, ligaments, and tendons, are much more clearly seen with MRI than with regular x-rays and CT; as a result, MRI is frequently used to image knee and shoulder injuries.

                MRI can distinguish between white and grey matter in the brain and can also be used to diagnose aneurysms and tumours. Because MRI does not use x-rays or other radiation, it is the preferred imaging modality when frequent imaging is required for diagnosis or therapy, particularly in the brain. MRI, on the other hand, is more expensive than x-ray imaging or CT scanning.

              <h2>Digital X-ray</h2>
              <p>For decades, the most common and non-invasive image diagnostic test has been digital X-rays. This image testing is requested in order to detect, diagnose, and monitor a variety of medical issues.
                Other imaging tests are typically used to assess difficult-to-reach areas (tissues, blood vessels, nerves, etc.), whereas a digital X-ray provides a quick picture of the bones, chest, teeth, and abdomen.
                Digital X-ray uses radioactive beams that pass through the body, where different body parts block the radiation, converting it into an image.
                
                Bones and metal in white

              <h2>Diagnostic Ultrasound</h2>
              <p>Diagnostic ultrasound, also known as sonography or diagnostic medical sonography, is a type of imaging that uses sound waves to create images of structures within your body. The images can provide useful information for diagnosing and treating a wide range of diseases and conditions.

                The majority of ultrasound exams are performed with an ultrasound device placed outside your body, though some require the placement of a small device inside your body.</p>
